# PyTorch Learning Repository

This repository contains my implementations of various deep learning models using PyTorch. I am using this space to practice and master PyTorch by building different architectures from scratch and experimenting with various techniques.

## Contents
- **Basic PyTorch Implementations**: Covering fundamental PyTorch operations, autograd, optimizers, and more.
- **Neural Network Architectures**: Implementations of classic and modern architectures, including:
  - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- **Custom Model Implementations**: Experiments with custom architectures and modifications.
- **Training and Optimization**: Techniques like transfer learning, fine-tuning, and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Dataset Handling**: Loading and preprocessing datasets using `torchvision` and `torchtext`.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pytorch-learning.git
   cd pytorch-learning
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run any script:
   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```
